The input file in.c60 is set up to perform the initial electronic quench for a C60 molecule.
The exact command line to run the code will depend on the mpi setup on your machine. This
run was performed using an openSUSE Tumbleweed 20170619  workstation with the following command line.

mpirun -np 16 ./rmg-cpu in.c60

The output is stored in the file

in.c60.00.log which is included for reference.

The absolute values of the total energy in this example differs from those generated by
earlier releases due to changes in potential setup.
