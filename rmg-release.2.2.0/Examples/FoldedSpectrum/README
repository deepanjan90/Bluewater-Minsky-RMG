Example of using the partitioned folded spectrum option to reduce the
execution time for an initial quench of a 512 atom diamond cell. The
base diagonalizer is lapack which the code uses for the first 6 steps.
The improvement in execution time may be seen by looking at the per
step times in the output file diamond512_lapackfolded_0.3.log.00.
Excluding the first step we see that lapack steps take around 16-17
seconds per step while the lapack-pfsm steps take around 11-12
seconds.
